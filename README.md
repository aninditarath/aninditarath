### 💬 Little Bit About Me

Hello! I’m Anindita Rath, a QA Automation Engineer with over 10 years of experience in the IT industry. I’ve worked across diverse domains including enterprise mobility, telecom, and cloud platforms, contributing to both MNCs and product-based companies. My focus is on building reliable, scalable, and efficient test automation solutions that ensure product quality at every stage.

My toolkit includes Selenium, Appium, RestAssured, Postman, TestNG, JUnit, Python, Java, and Shell scripting, along with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Maven, and Git. I’ve also explored emerging areas like AI-powered testing and visual validation techniques to enhance coverage and user experience.

I strongly believe that testing goes beyond scripts—it's about clean code, domain understanding, and user empathy. Outside of my technical work, I’m a blogger, poet, and open mic performer, always seeking creative ways to express ideas and share knowledge.

Driven by the philosophy of #SharingIsCaring, I’m here to contribute, collaborate, and grow with this incredible community of testers, technologists, and creatives.
